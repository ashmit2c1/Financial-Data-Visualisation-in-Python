    "Stocks ( also called shares or equity ) represent ownership in a company, when one buys a stock, one is, in layman's terms, buying a small piece of that company, known as a share\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about stocks are as follows\n",
    "- Owning a stock means you own a small part of the company\n",
    "- If the company ends up doing well, the value of the shares can go up and you receive dividends ( a share of the company profits )\n",
    "- If the company does poorly, you lose the money you invested \n",
    "- Stocks are typically bought and sold on stock exchanges like BSE, NSE, NYSE\n",
    "\n",
    "If you buy 10 shares of Apple stocks and Apple has 10 million shares in total, you own a tiny fraction of Apple. If the share price goes up from $150 to $200, then your investment grows, however if it drops down to $100 then we lose money on our investment\n",
